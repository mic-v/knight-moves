# Knight Moves

A fun visualizer of how a knight in chess can move from one square to another
Uses Vite for development and vitest for testing knight moves

## Features

- Chessboard display with a knight that shows the moves
- Input with starting square and end square
- Output all the moves from start to finish
- Display player that allows you to go step by step in each move

## Reasons I used Vite(mostly subjective)

- Wanted to try it out instead of NPM
- Documentation website format was better compared to NPM's
- Learning new technologies

## Knight Moves
- Uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path
